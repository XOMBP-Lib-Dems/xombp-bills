present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

**1 Moratorium on construction of buildings with gas heating or cooking**

(1) Any construction project that applies for planning approval following
    the enactment of this law will be denied approval if it uses natural gas
    for heating or cooking.
    (a) An exception will be granted for commercial kitchens to use
        gas for cooking.

        (ii) School or office cafeterias
        (iii) Food kitchens

**2 Retrofit buildings to phase out gas heating and cooking by 2030**

(1) Any private building owner who retrofits their building to replace gas
    with electric may claim a refundable tax credit of 50% of the cost
    of the retrofit.
(2) Local governments that wish to retrofit council houses under their
    management may claim a grant of 100% of the cost of the retrofit.
(3) All buildings must be retrofitted to replace natural gas heating and
    cooking appliances (except those used in commercial kitchens) with
    electrical equivalents by the year 2030.
    (a) After January 1st, 2030, private owners of buildings that still use
        natural gas for heating or cooking (with the exception of commercial

        year.
    (b) This fine shall increase by £20 per square meter of floor space every
        year until 2050, at which point the fine will stay at £500 per
